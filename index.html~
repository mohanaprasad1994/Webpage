            <p align="justify">Hello!! I am Mohana Prasad Sathya Moorthy and was born on 24th of December 1994 (Christmas eve). I have spent almost 95% of my life at Chennai, India. My family includes my parents and my kind little sister. P.S.Senior Secondary School, Mylapore was my second home where I spent 15 memorable years. I owe a lot to my school for the amazing teachers and friends, who gradually shaped me and my personality. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Stanford University. I graduated with B.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Madras in July 2016.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">

               As a person, I am jovial, fun loving and am easily approachable. My academic activities are anyway presented in the other sections of this page, so I would like to focus here on my leisure time activities. I enjoy solving puzzles. I actively participate in puzzling and coding events, and have won awards at various technical festivals. After gaining some experience, I started conducting and coordinating Puzzle Championship events at our institute. I love taking up positions of responsibility. I had a lot of fun with my energetic team of 20 students, when I held the "Super Coordinator" role at EXEBIT 2015. I was also the in charge of Web Operations for Computer Vision Group, IIT Madras for a while. People around me say, I am good at creative writing - Thanks to my articles in school magazines. Couple of years ago, one of my stories won an award for being in the "Top 25", in a nation wide story writing competition conducted by Scholastic India. I also spend considerable amount of time on Quora, reading on topics related to science, cricket and politics. I play Tennis, Badminton and am also a regular swimmer. There is another important activity that I do, I regularly teach the underprivileged kids in my locality. I strongly believe that educating the deprived is essential for equitable and sustained development of a country. I have devoted a separate section in this web page detailing some of my efforts [<a class="smoothscroll" href="#interests">Click Here</a>]. If you have any comments/suggestions/ideas regarding these, please feel free to contact me. If you wish to teach at some of the schools that I was associated with - Do let me know.

            This project is aimed at building a fast similarity join operation that scales to tables with billions of entries. I am currently working with the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset. Previously, I extended the SNAP library to 64-bit SNAP and modified it to support huge datasets (> 2 billion nodes
and edges). [<a href="https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap-dev-64">Github Link</a>] <br>

           Aimed at multicore scaling of the <a href="http://fastpass.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Fastpass</a> centralized arbiter which allocates timeslots for every packet sent in the network. The timeslot allocator's core algorithm needs to compute maximal matching in a bipartite graph for every timeslot [<a href="http://fastpass.mit.edu/Fastpass-SIGCOMM14-Perry.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a>] and I was assigned the task of developing scalable multicore architectures/solutions for it. I analyzed the existing pipelined cores allocation architecture and tried several modifications (such as batch processing) by trading off latency and fairness for 1.5x better throughput. With careful experiments, I identified the constraints in the architecture which restricted linear scaling only upto 8 CPU cores. Subsequently, I implemented a completely new parallel allocation architecture where each core handles a subset of the input requests in parallel and special reconciliation cores were designed to handle contending or wrong allocations (arising due to parallel nature of the allocations). Both shared memory and unshared memory systems were tried. This architecture looked quite promising in theory but in practice did not give much gain due to inter-core communication overheads in the Intel DPDK queues used. To correct this, I devised and implemented a novel distributor structure which used cache lines for inter core communication. I then developed a new innovative framework that is 4x more efficient, overcomes the shortcomings of prior architectures (both the pipelined cores and the parallel architecture tried) and easily scales to large number of cores. <br>

            “Multimodal content based summarization of instructional videos” - Task was to develop a system that automatically generates shorter summary videos of classroom lectures (like MIT OpenCourseWare) without losing important content. I proposed a solution with three research components involving video processing, Natural Language Processing and Speech processing. <b>This solution has been filed for patent at US PTO.</b><br>
            For the video processing part, I developed a method to identify and extract key content frames in videos, for summarizing classroom lectures and evaluated them against manual summaries. These extracted frames were also shown to facilitate efficient non-linear video navigation, video browsing, and streaming in low bandwidth networks. Later that year, we wrote a paper incorporating this technique for non-linear video navigation, which got <b>accepted at ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI 2015)</b>.<br>
            In the second part of the internship, I designed and developed an extractive summarization technique to summarize speech transcripts incorporating concept relevance
            (importance in neighborhood) and summary diversity. This technique was shown to give 10-15% better results than standard generic text summarizers available. <br>

            <h3>ECN based Congestion Control for a Software Defined Network</h3>
            <p class="info" align="justify">Aug 2015 – Nov 2015, Adviser: <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~skrishnam/" target="_blank"><u>Prof. Krishna M Sivalingam
</u></a> (IIT Madras)</p>
               <p align="justify">
            This project deals with congestion control in a software defined network (SDN) setting. Presently, explicit router schemes, such as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), work in conjunction with the TCP protocol to handle congestion in a distributed manner. With the emergence of SDN and centralized control, it is possible to leverage the global view of the network state to make better congestion control decisions. In this work, we explored the advantages of bringing in global information into distributed congestion control. We proposed a framework where the controller with its global view of the network actively participates in the congestion control decisions of the end TCP hosts, by setting the ECN bits of IP packets appropriately. Our framework can be deployed very easily without any change to the end node TCPs or the SDN switches. We also showed 30x improvement over the TCP Cubic variant and 1.7x improvement over TCP/RED in terms of flow completion times for one implementation of this framework.<br>

            <h3>Interpretable clusters on categorical variable datasets</h3>

               <p align="justify">
            We started-off by exploring and experimenting with different methods for clustering categorical data sets. A clustering approach like K-means over one-hot encoding gives you cluster centroids as a vector of floating point numbers. Interpreting these numbers for business applications is a difficult task. I pursued this problem of finding clustering methods that yield human interpretable rules for clusters.<!--  - One Naive way to achieve it is to run K-Means to cluster and then use a decision tree to learn rules for these clusters. Can we do better? --> I modelled the clustering task as a hypergraph partitioning problem on a line graph to get interpretable clusters. I then devised a frequent itemset mining based approach for clustering to extract human interpretable rules for clusters and looked at the method's theoritical explanations. I also worked on a hypergraph sparsification method for feature reduction. The experiments were all conducted on large real world customer dataset of IFMR - an insurance company.

            <b>Proposed a model for real time detection and tracking of human hand in video streams for gesture recognition purposes.</b> I worked with <a href="http://www.gnebehay.com/tld/" target="_blank">OpenTLD</a>, a semi-automated single-target tracking algorithm (not suitable to track generic human hand as it can be in any orientation and can change its shape rapidly). I formulated the solution of integrating SVM classifiers trained over Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features into the OpenTLD's detection algorithm for detecting and tracking human hand at realtime speeds. I modified the  Georg Nebehay’s C++ implementation of OpenTLD.

               <p align="justify">
                       We demonstrated a system that makes mistakes like a child and gradually learns basic arithmetic on integers. <!-- Simple arithmetic has few hundred facts and some simple algorithms.But human brain is slow in computing these and inaccurate as well. A child learns a lot of linguistic words everyday, way faster than learning simple math. --> Neural networks are often said to display brain style computation. We sought answer to the question: Can Neural Networks mimic human learning of arithmetic? <br>
                       <!-- We understood how children start to learn arithmetic and analyzed the different types of errors that humans make in arithmetic with a detailed literature survey.  -->We used an appropriate feature representation for numbers which accounts for the symbolic distance effects. We then proposed a Hopfield Network based system for mimicking how a child learns arithmetic and demonstrated that it makes mistakes like a child and gradually learns arithmetic. It is shown to replicate common human errors such as Operand errors, Table errors, non-Table errors and the frequency and priming theory of learning math facts. I did this work as my Memory Based Reasoning in AI course Project.

            <b><font color="black" size="4">Bridging Phylogeny and Taxonomy with
Protein-protein Interaction Networks (Social and Information Network Analysis at Stanford) [<a href="cs224w.pdf" target="_blank">Report link</a>]</font></b><br>
            The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network provides an overview of the complex biological reactions vital to an organism’s
metabolism and survival. Even though in the past PPI network were compared across organisms in detail, there has not been
large-scale research on how individual PPI networks reflect on the species relationships. In this study we aim to increase our
understanding of the tree of life and taxonomy by gleaming information from the PPI networks. We successful created (1) a predictor of
network statistics based on known traits of existing species in the phylogeny, and (2) a taxonomic classifier of organism using the
known protein network statistics, whether experimentally determined or predicted de novo. With the knowledge of protein interactions
at its core, our two models effectively connects two field with widely diverging methodologies–the phylogeny and taxonomy of species.<br>

            <b><font color="black" size="4">Vesta - Voice Controlled Music Assistant (Introduction to Human Computer Interaction at Stanford) [<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs147/projects/Home/Vesta/" target="_blank">Project webpage</a>]</font></b><br>
            These days, many people spend hours at a workplace, only to come home drained and exhausted. Our goal is to bring back energy into everyone's home lives. Vesta is a voice-controlled, intelligent audio assistant for that motivates you using audio - it wakes you up, encourages you to do your household chores, prepares you for events (such as meetings or dates), and plays music based on your mood. Why not add background music to your life? And be the star in your own movie..<br>

            <b><font color="black" size="4">AI for playing Minesweeper (Artificial Intelligence at Stanford) </font></b><br>
            Implemented a Constraint satisfaction based approach and a reinforcement learning with appropriate funtion approximation for building a AI that plays Minesweeper.<br>
            <b><font color="black" size="4">Mining Click Event Stream of E-Commerce Websites (Data Mining)</font></b><br>
            Given a sequence of click events performed by some user during a typical session in an e-commerce website, the goal is to predict whether the user is going to buy something or not, and if he is buying, what would be the items he is going to buy. We proposed frequent subsequence mining and frequent itemset mining based methods and compared against KNN. Finally proposed a hybrid of KNN and decision tree classification model and showed significant improvement in accuracy of prediction.<br>

        <u><h2> Educating the Underprivileged in India</h2></u><br>
        <p align="justify">
          I strongly believe that educating the underprivileged is important for sustainable development of a country. India enacted the Right To Education Act(RTE) in 2009. Indian Government has set up a large number of schools across the country but these schools suffer from poor infrastructure, poor teacher-student ratios, lack of qualified teachers and high dropout rates.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I decided to give something back to the society and I have been regularly teaching deprived students of my city  through various social service programs. I would like to elaborate on three such efforts here.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          During my 12th grade at school, few like minded friends and myself started creating video clips in regional languages where we explained physics concepts with small experiments set in our school lab. It was aimed for students of rural areas where the schools do not have proper laboratory facilities. We won an award at SHAASTRA 2012 for our efforts. Here is a video that we made:<br>

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I was teaching the middle school students of Velachery Government Higher Secondary school in their regional medium for a year as part of National Social Service Scheme. IIT Madras. I spent about 3 hours a week with these kids. My stint at this school helped me understand their hardships and struggles. I found that their computer science lab (which existed, Thankfully) wasn't operational nor did they have a computer science teacher. I took personal initiative and fixed most of their computers to make their lab function again. I also specially trained top 10 students of the same school for the NTSE examination. It was a proud moment to receive the "Star Volunteer" distinction from the hands of M.S Swaminathan (The man behind India's Green Revolution), for my service at this school.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          During 2015 I spent about 6 hours every week (for 4 months) teaching the underprivileged children of Olcott School, Besant Nagar. The attention span of these kids were very short and I had to come up with innovative and interesting experiments to teach them. It was a challenging and rewarding exercise. I also specially coached top 10 students of the class for their class 10 board examinations. It was a pleasure to see them perform well.
        </p>

        <u><h2> Other Co-curricular Activities</h2></u><br>
        <p align="justify">
           I was entrusted with the "Super Coordinator" role at EXEBIT 2015, where I led a team of 20 students (and many volunteers) and was responsible for planning, organizing and conducting 11 technical events with 800+ participations. Have also held coordinator and volunteer roles for events during the earlier editions of Exebit. Exebit is the student organized technical festival of CSE dept, IIT Madras.
